    "selftext": "\nFOR THOSE WHO WANT TO SEE THE SCHOOLS REPLY WND MY REPLY THE LINK TO MY NEW POST IS: https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/s/YX2ToB1ifX\n\nMe and my mate were joking around after and a little during the lesson, but honestly, deep down I thought it was actually really sexist. So I decided to write and send an email to the school, pretending to be a concerned parent.\n\nThe email wasn’t a joke, everything I said in it was true, and I didn’t exaggerate anything. I’m posting this here to ask if anyone else thinks what I did was fair or if I’ve gone too far. I just feel like if no one says anything, they’ll keep teaching it like that.\n\nBasically the whole lesson made it seem like only men are abusers and only women are victims. There was a super biased headline used and barely anything about male victims or female perpetrators.\n\nHere’s the email I sent (copy pasted below):\n\n“Dear Safeguarding/Pastoral/PSHE Team,\n\n\n\nI hope you are well.\n\n\n\nI am writing to express serious concern about a PSHE lesson my child took part in today, which focused on consent and sexual offences. I fully support the need to educate young people on these important issues, but the way this particular lesson was delivered was, in my view, inappropriate and potentially damaging.\n\n\n\nThe lesson made use of the headline “Men must prove a woman said ‘yes’ under tough new rape rules”, which I found highly concerning. While I understand that the actual law applies to everyone regardless of gender, the use of this headline presents the issue in an extremely one-sided way. It gives the impression that only men are responsible for abuse and only women can be victims, which is simply not true and not acceptable to teach to young people as fact.\n\n\n\nMy child came home feeling uncomfortable, and expressed feeling as though boys are automatically seen as threats. This kind of messaging can unfairly influence how children view themselves and each other. It risks planting the idea that boys are inherently dangerous and that girls should be afraid of them. This is not only inaccurate but deeply unfair to boys who are just as capable of understanding respect and boundaries.\n\n\n\nThe lesson also referenced the statistic that 85,000 women per year are victims of rape, which is of course tragic and important to acknowledge. However, there was no mention at all of male victims. This omission sends the message that boys and men cannot be victims themselves, which is both false and harmful. It makes it less likely that a boy would feel comfortable coming forward if something ever happened to him, for fear of being dismissed or seen as weak. That should never be the case.\n\n\n\nMore broadly, the entire lesson seemed to focus almost exclusively on male-on-female sexual harassment and assault. I do appreciate that the male teacher made an effort to portray the issue as something that affects both genders. There was even an example included involving a gay couple and another where a woman was pressuring a man to have sex even though he was tired. These additions were important and helped provide a more rounded perspective. However, the core materials and tone of the lesson still felt very one-sided. If it had been taught by a cover teacher or someone less thoughtful, I believe students might not have received the message that sexual assault and consent issues are not limited to just women being victims. That should not depend on the discretion of the individual teacher, but be built clearly into the lesson itself.\n\n\n\nI have used a private email address for this message because I do not want myself or my child to be identified and potentially face prejudice or different treatment from any members of staff who may come across this concern. I hope you will understand that this is simply a protective measure to allow me to speak honestly without risking any negative consequences for my child.\n\n\n\nI would appreciate it if you could let me know what materials were used during this lesson and whether the school has plans to revisit the topic in a more balanced and inclusive way. I hope that future lessons on this subject will be amended accordingly to show a full and accurate picture of sexual harassment and assault, including that anyone can be a victim, anyone can be a perpetrator, and that mutual respect and consent apply equally to all genders and relationships. The focus should be on shared responsibility and awareness, not on placing blame or fear on one group of students.\n\n\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. I look forward to your response.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nParent”\n\n\n\n",
