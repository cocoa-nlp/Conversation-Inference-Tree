    "selftext": "I’m 23 and about to start teaching high school. There’s not really anything inappropriate on my profile (Hinge) but since my age range is 22-26, I’m worried about like an older sibling or cousin of one of my students finding my profile. I used to let my younger sister rate people on my Hinge feed lol so I don’t think it’s that unlikely for someone to see my page and connect the dots and ask their younger sibling “hey isn’t this your teacher?” and all of a sudden those kids know way more about me than I ever want them to. I feel like it’s best to keep my personal life extremely private from my students especially since we’re so close in age. Has anyone else made this decision? Or decided not to get off dating apps, and have advice for success in that case?\nETA: I’m female.",

So what if you get matched with a relative of a student. The kid will be gone before you know it, but a relationship lasts years, if it's a good one. As long as it's not a parent of a current student, just move forward. You don't have to be a non-human, you just have to be a decent person in public.",

Not only on dating apps, but on all socials. Prepare your accounts to filter anonymous, and always keep in mind you can be stalked/messed around with. \nNot saying my solution was best, but I decided to delete all of my socials altogether, to avoid anything I said, even as a joke, against me. \nPeople I want to talk to need to go through iMessage contact verification. \n\nEven fake linked in profile was once created by a 14yo, just so she can pretend to know me better and be fascinated by my work. Language clearly wasn’t right, but they can today use ChatGPT to sound more mature you won’t even know. \nJust thinking about this paranoia gives me a headache now. \n\nUp to you if you want to stay available to any extent at socials, but what I am sure of, all data you leave there will be found sooner or later, so act accordingly. \nAll from my experience.",

I'm inclined to say no, because you shouldn't give up your life for your job; however, you will want to be VERY cognizant of what information is on your profile. Kudos for asking someone else to look at it, but you might have another adult look at it from their POV to see if there's anything that might make them 'cringe'. If there is no cringeworthy information included, you should be okay.\n\nUltimately, if someone is looking, they can find information that you may not want them to know, but if you limit your information (even if you put a note on there that explains why) to the best of your ability, then you should be fine.",
