    "selftext": "This is for all the new teachers out there. Let’s talk social media for a moment. Most of this will be obvious. But at least one person will find this helpful, so I figured I’d go ahead and say it. Again. \n\nNew teachers, lock down your social media. Set the privacy settings as high as you can go. Even if it’s private, scrub your social media of anything that is even mildly objectionable. If it’s something you don’t want parents or students seeing, delete it. Do not accept friend requests from parents or students. Do not send friend requests to parents or students. I’ve seen both happen. Do not call parents from your cell phone. \n\nAlso, make an account for as many social media sites as you can, even if you don’t use them. I have Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X, Threads, BlueSky, Mastodon, and SnapChat. I’ve never posted on anything but FB. I have the others just in case a kid decides to be funny and make a spoof account of me. He was sending inappropriate mess to other students pretending to be me from the spoof account. I didn’t know about it until a parent emailed me. That’s how I figured it out. I had to fill out a police report and everything not to defend myself, but to cover my ass. I showed the deputy my real account and the spoof account. That’s as far as that went. \n\nSidebar: Do not stay late, take work home, or work on the weekends. Your time is YOUR TIME. Do not give the school free labor. Working off the clock is unpaid overtime. Work your contract. Do not put your work email on your phone. Do not connect your phone to the school WiFi. ",

Do not ask me to do anything outside of those hours. My answer will be no. Wednesdays are short days for students, but the same contract time for teachers. It’s built-in for staff meetings, etc. I’ve been known to walk out of a faculty meeting that’s running a little long. Admin was glaring at me, but they knew I was right and they couldn’t do a damn thing about it. \n\nDo not take work home. Do not stay late or go in early. Do not work on the weekends. The school will not implode if you’re not running yourself ragged and destroying your mental health. The best advice I can give you is “do not set yourself on fire to keep the school warm.” Do not feel guilty for taking a day off and requesting a sub. The students will be fine. Let’s be honest, subs aren’t much more than babysitters for most classes. You’ll give an assignment, most likely digital on something like Canvas, a third of the kids will do it, and the school didn’t get sucked into a black hole because you weren’t there. Almost every new teacher goes through that. I sure did. That’s part of the reason why I’m the way I am now. 🤷🏻‍♂️",
