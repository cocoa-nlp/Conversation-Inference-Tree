    "selftext": "This happened a while back but was just reminded of it. (I’m a male if that matters). \n\nAfter class one day most of the students had left but one boy (14 I’d say) was just sitting at his desk with his head on the desk in his hands. None of the other students seemed to have noticed.\n\nHe was quiet but eventually I realized he was crying a bit. I walked over and put my hand on his shoulder and asked “everything okay bud?” He said “I’m fine. Can I just sit here a minute?” I had no class next so I said okay. I felt a little awkward but I just sat at my desk and gave him some space. He stayed for a few minutes and eventually left. \n\nAs he was leaving he just said “thanks.” Again I asked if he was okay. He said he was fine. That was it. Talked to another teacher, they said what I did was fine. Maybe be a little more careful with the touching but otherwise fine.\n\nThis particular kid is pretty quiet/reserved. Great grades. Never any behavior issues in class. Very nice. Just rarely speaks. Other than that day there’s been no other concerning behavior. Nothing I felt I needed to report or anything. \n\nIt was a relatively minor event in the grand scheme of things, but for some reason I think about it a lot. Not sure why honestly. I’m on the newer side of teaching, guess I’m still learning how to handle things they don’t always teach you in school. ",

I was a good kid, decent grades, always well behaved, but I was painfully quiet, had no friends, was bullied, and had alcoholic parents at home who I couldn't confide in. I was miserable and thought no one wanted, liked, or loved me. I'm not saying that's what's going on here but it sounds similar to me. At 14 I was also contemplating suicide pretty heavily because I was just so tired of being alone. Honestly, it was a teacher who helped me stay the course with some positive comments and interactions. Be there for him if he needs it. If he's like me, even though he trusted you enough to break down in your class, he'll be embarrassed about it and not want to discuss it directly.",

Especially if it happens again in someone else's presence and you're not aware of it.\n\n*Edit to add:* One possibility I didn't think of originally that makes informing the counselor even more important - this student MIGHT have done this in another room without your knowledge before you witnessed it. It is very important it is documented so that if what you saw wasn't the first time, the counselor can follow up with them or possibly their parents and start to ask questions.",

            "body": "With teenagers, just like with adults, all you have to do is listen to them, and not act uncomfortable/panicked by their crying.\n\nBy “listen to them,” I mean, ask them what they want you to do, and then believe them and do exactly that. This is what you did when he said he wanted to sit there for a minute, and you agreed and then gave him space without leaving him alone. That was exactly the right move. Everyone is different - some people might need to vent their emotions and tell you what’s wrong, and then they feel better after saying it out loud. Others want to be left alone to process their big feelings, not bothered or pressured to talk about it. Others may want you to offer advice or reassurance. Some may want to go see another adult in the building, often the counselor or a teacher they’re close with, like their sped case manager or a coach or something. But you can’t assume what they want - let them tell you. People often cry when they feel out of control, and my experience has been that by giving them what they say they need, it helps them feel a bit better - I don’t know if it’s because it lets them have some control, or makes them feel safer, or what.\n\nThe part where you don’t act uncomfortable or panicked is really important, especially for you as a man. Not because you’re uncomfortable, but because in high schools, many male employees have a tendency to freeze when someone cries, then try to quickly pawn the kid off on either a counselor, or the nearest female employee. So by you not doing that, but instead staying calm and giving them what they need, you’re modeling empathy for them, and showing them that their big feelings are normal, and not something you’re scared of. And showing them that men can handle big feelings, too. This is going to help them calm down more in the moment, but it’s also good for them in the long term for you to be a positive male role model.\n\nJust a reminder - don’t tell them not to cry. Sometimes people do this meaning to demonstrate care, like “I don’t want you to be sad!” or “I don’t want you to cry about this!” but in the moment, it can feel less like “this person feels empathy for my sadness” and more like they’re dismissing or invalidating your feelings.",

If they need to talk to someone, the counselor is appropriate and isn't someone they have to face every day in class.  For contacting parentes, it depends.  If I already know that the kid has an ongoing difficulty and the parents are aware, I will let the parent know the kid had a bad day.  If there is a pattern that indicates the kid might be depressed, I will contact parents to let them know I am concerned about the kid's general well-being.  Contacting a parent over a single random incident - I usually don't.  If I've notified the counselor, they will do that if it is necessary.",

If it's in the middle of class, I usually just get everybody moving on whatever we have to do that day, then try to discreetly go check in. If they want to talk, we step out for a moment and chat (more them talking and me listening/validating), if not, I ask if they want to go get some water, take a short break, whatever.

He said no, and you respected that. I think it's probably good to be aware of the touching thing, especially since he may have a fight-or-flight response to an unexpected touch if he's having big feelings. What I would do is crouch in front of him and then ask if everything's okay. But honestly, you read the situation, and you responded just fine. \n\nI love when men can be emotionally present with students, especially male students.

Middle schoolers, man, they go through it all in 30 minutes.\n\n\nMy school's counselors meet with their students multiple times a year, and it's not unusual to be called to see the counselor. Because of that, I email them also and give a heads up \"Brynleyyyeigh says grandma isn't doing well. Can you check up on her the next few weeks?\" \"Braxxtonck says mom is pretty sick AND grandpa died. Can you check on him and see if he'll need extra support?\"",

No one is fine all the time” 99% of the time, they tell me what’s going on. Then I will offer a hug, a snack, or to call their counselor if they think they need to leave class for a little bit. They rarely opt the counselor route, but I email the counselor later to let them know what’s going on just to be safe. I also follow up with them a few days later. Most boys want me to pretend it never happened and most girls will let me know if they were able to resolve whatever was going on. \n\nI teach middle school and this system seems to work really well for my students! If you don’t have an office they can step in to, you could ask if they want to move to the hallway or back of the room. I also always ask if they want to run to the bathroom when they’re done crying to splash cold water on their face. It gives them a couple more minutes to calm down, and helps cool their face down.",

But if this is a quiet student and a behavior you haven’t seen before, I think it’s important to chat with the counselor. Typically, for a generally quiet student, crying in class sounds like their worst nightmare - which shows whatever was bothering him was painful enough they couldn’t avoid it. If you haven’t already, try to establish relationships with the school counselors to see how well they handle things and what their sensitivity to the students is like. At my school, counselors are generally pretty sensitive with cases like this and know how to check in on the kid without saying, “Ms ____ told me you were crying the other day.” They can navigate it without the student realizing they’ve been “outed” - if they’re solid at their job. Our primary goal is to ensure the student’s safety, and this is part of looking out for them. I think OP did a great job in just being there and present for the kid, and they’re going to remember that for a long time—students appreciate teachers who make space for them. But as I’ve worked with students and had more encounters like this, having a chat with the counselor afterwards has worked best. It hasn’t ruined a relationship with a student yet. Some students just ended up having a bad day and failed a test, and some of my students really needed help, and they got it this way. Use tact, always approach with sensitivity and concern, and things will turn out okay.",

Sprinkle one or two of the obvious A students in near the beginning, and no one thinks they're in trouble either, and it helps to lower the anxiety of a student being called forward.\n\nWorst case, you get a little extra data about grades. Best case, you can resolve many more underlying issues AND get time to improve a relationship with someone who will never speak up during a whole class activity or lecture. One that comes to mind is a student who I barely knew what their voice sounded like because they never spoke. They were starting to slip in class, and just a few minutes of casual conversation led to them confiding about food not being available at home and adults rarely being present. They did not know of any of the school resources for sending food home, that many peers have free breakfast and lunch, or that the counselor can be seen by anyone at any time.
