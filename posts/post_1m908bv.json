    "selftext": "I just started at a new district, and when I went to pick up my computer, the tech guy had me download two apps to my personal phone. One app for district wide safety alerts, and one app that would....I'm not entirely sure. It allowed generated codes to log onto district email even if you weren't at work. (Yeah, trust me, I won't be checking email if I'm not at work.) \n\nWell, I have an old shitty phone (hi, I'm a poor teacher) and I had to delete like, 5 of my own personal apps in order to make room for the district's apps. And then they basically bricked my phone because they took up soooooo much space. I went on vacation shortly after and couldn't take a single picture, so I deleted both of those apps to make room so I could take pictures. \n\nI want to refuse to re-download them. The only person paying this phone bill is me. I don't have the money (or desire) to upgrade my phone. I don't like the idea of not getting safety alerts, but surely there is a better way to alert staff other than having them download space-gobbling apps onto personal devices. Is this a reasonable boundary? ",

            "body": "Hi! I work as a security manager for a high education institution. I can speak to the account security side of your question:\n\nAny security minded institution is going to require multifactor authentication for their employee (and hopefully student) accounts. One of the easiest ways to handle this is an authentication app on your phone, such as microsoft, yubico, okta, DUO, and so on authenticator apps. These apps are account agnotistic, so they also provide a place for you to set up multifactor authentication for your other accounts. For instance, my Reddit MFA is through my microsoft authenticator.\n\nIf you do not wish to use your phone, there should be options for alternatives. This can include a one-time passcode fob, a FIDO2 key, or some other device-driven authenticator. We usually recommend the phone-based apps as you are much less likely to forget your phone, but that does not mean other options are viable. If you opt for a device-based authentication method such as OTP or a security key, there may be clauses concerning the loss of the device or replacement costs. That is 100% up to the individual institution.\n\nThere have been a few comments regarding frustration when it comes to multifactor authentication. It may not seem important to you or in your position, however, it can affect both the institution and you in big ways.\n\nFor the institution, they likely have cybersecurity insurance or other requirements that protect them in the case of a ransomware or data breach event. There are individuals that can be found criminally negligent at a certain level, and they certainly do not want to end up in that position. These repercussions can trickle down (though not extraordinarily likely). There was a case at Georgia Tech where a professor was caught up in a case where the DoD sued the school for fraud over not using antivirus software ([After cybersecurity lab wouldn’t use AV software, US accuses Georgia Tech of fraud - Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/08/oh-your-cybersecurity-researchers-wont-use-antivirus-tools-heres-a-federal-lawsuit/))\n\nOn a more personal front, your school credentials access a LOT more than just your computer. I've seen instances where an account has been compromised, and the threat actor attempted to change the employee's bank details so their pay would be deposited into another account. I've seen an account compromise that led to a professor's account being used to send phishing emails to their students requesting passwords. I've seen accounts get compromised and used to send crazy ranting emails to news stations across the surrounding area.\n\nAll of this is to say that as much as multifactor authentication protects the school, it absolutely protects you too!",
