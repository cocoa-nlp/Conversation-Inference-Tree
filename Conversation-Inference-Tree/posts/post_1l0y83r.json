If you understood the history, then you‚Äôd know that we are remembering the anniversary of the Stonewall riots in New York, which helped gain our rights not only in the US, but around the world as well. Our current political climate means that the fight isn‚Äôt over and as long as there‚Äôs people who are fighting to take away our rights to keep us oppressed then there shouldn‚Äôt be a reason why we should stay hidden just because people don‚Äôt like us. I myself used to shun myself for my own sexuality and tried to hide it from the public, but it still didn‚Äôt stop me from people figuring out, getting outed, and becoming a victim of anti-gay harassment and violence in high school. In the end, when I graduated, I was still keeping myself shunned for being gay until I went to my first college class and saw a pride flag in front of my college professors‚Äô door. I knew that when I saw that, that I felt genuine support outside of my online friend group. Sure they can hate us, but that‚Äôs a them problem. Whether we do this or not, we‚Äôre still going to be hated no matter what so might as well do it.",
