    "selftext": "I‚Äôm a first year sped teacher in k-2. I‚Äôm super excited and nervous but ready for a change. I‚Äôve been doing my orientation meetings and recently had my cpi (crisis prevention intervention) class. I have a background in the medical field and a good amount of experience specifically with hospice. I‚Äôve dealt with some heavy stuff and have a background with how to deal with sensitive topics. So going into the cpi class I was expecting to be taught skills and concepts to help me with students. \nThis cpi class blew me away with how insensitive, demeaning, and narcissistic the instructor was. The instructor is one of the SPED district member who oversees multiple schools in the district and new sped teachers. She told us upon arrival that we were going to wait for others to arrive since 6 people were missing. Total class was like 10 people. I thought okay we‚Äôll wait like 10minutes. Nope, we sat there for 45 minutes. Only 1 other person showed up in that time. The instructor then opened the class up by saying, ‚Äú I‚Äôll either like you or not, but you‚Äôll definitely know‚Äù. \nOnce we started she talked about the perfect student and how we need to describe the perfect student in our assigned groups. We did so by writing words that come to mind. She passed out crayons in the meantime and we were confused why and asked. She said she wasn‚Äôt going to say. Once we start going through each group and saying what we wrote she tells use we are all wrong because we didn‚Äôt use the crayons she gave us and just wrote words. Then she wants us to verbally explain our perfect student. One teacher said she doesn‚Äôt have a perfect student and all have different great qualities. You would have thought that she said something offensive due to how this instructors demeanor changed. For the next 15 minutes, the instructor verbally argued with this teacher about how she‚Äôs wrong and demeaning other students who are perfect by saying there are no perfect students. Somehow it got into religion and that got weird and everyone in the room looked super uncomfortable. I have never seen anything like this before in a professional setting especially with an instructor who has been working in the district for 25+ years. The rest of the classes duration no one‚Äôs option was correct and she would tell them that. It was crazy. She went over how to deal with student who have anxiety, depression, and anger issues but it was the most basic common sense stuff. For example, ‚ÄúStudents may have stuff going on at home that makes them act out in school‚Äù. \nA lot of the people in the class were teachers but also counselors, social workers, paras from outside the state. I ran into a couple of other teachers/paras on their way out and they were shocked with it all too and nervous about working in the district. \nI‚Äôm honestly feeling discouraged if this is the leadership in my district and how a cpi class is taught by someone who is so insensitive and rude. I have a feeling that my students won‚Äôt be my biggest stressor rather the district itself. Just venting here but also looking to see how common this behavior is. ",

This will NOT change.  I repeat a mantra \"I am here for the kids and I know what I am doing\".  Much of the nonsense admin folks tell you does not relate to your life situation and to how you interact with students.  Learn to ignore it with a smile.  NEVER fight them, or make them feel defensive by letting them know how experienced you are.\n\nThe students need your love and passion - don't waste your energy fighting idiots or trying to change them.",

She was muttering ‚Äúthis is bullshit,‚Äù when I came across her ü§£.\n\nThe trainings can be awful, people are so burnt out and you can find yourself wondering why they‚Äôre even in education in the first place. Sometimes they‚Äôre representative of the districts that hold them, sometimes it‚Äôs just a few bad presenters. I‚Äôve had a handful of okay trainings and one or two gems. Look to teachers you admire for inspiration and keep your head up, this is just a small portion of teaching. I‚Äôm sorry you had to sit through that.\n\nAnd IDK if it helps, but I‚Äôm always BRUTALLY honest in my feedback forms after trainings. I‚Äôve even gone as far as teaching out to curriculum reps. I try to do the same for the good ones too, but letting the folks running the training know how uncomfortable that session was *may* change up how it looks in the future.",
