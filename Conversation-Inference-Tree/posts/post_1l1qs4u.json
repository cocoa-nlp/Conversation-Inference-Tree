You literally wrote nothing related to any of the math problems... you didn't even attempt them.\n\nThese aren't even hard problems. You didn't have to doodle during the quiz. You could have doodled after the quiz. And yet you consciously chose to instead ignore the questions... and doodle.\n\nThis is on you bro.",
