If you have a miscarriage, you'll be fine provided that you've gone to a hospital or have notified authorities.\n\nEdit: This comment came off differently than I intended, I am very sorry for that. I meant that the article title frames it as miscarriage itself being classified as illegal, while the law is going after something else (improper disposal). The second part is how you can avoid legal trouble due to this new law, I am not in support of it, I am dead against it. Unfortunately, people live in this region and might not be able to move due to various circumstances, and you have to follow the laws of the area you are in. This comment was just to provide more information regarding the law and the steps you'll need to take in order to stay safe in this region. Stay safe out there guys, and sorry for the misunderstanding.",

Agnew is charged with disinterment/displacement of a dead body and other offenses stemming from multiple incidents.\n\nhttps://wvmetronews.com/2025/06/02/raleigh-county-prosecutor-opens-pandoras-box-on-miscarriage-and-criminal-charges/",
