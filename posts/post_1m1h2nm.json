    "selftext": "I honestly didn‚Äôt know which flair to use. I‚Äôm not new- 4 years in- but there is a retired teacher in my area offering her services to help get classrooms together for $25 an hour. She explicitly states she will NOT be moving furniture or cleaning but basically just laminating, cutting, organizing, bulletin boards etc. I just wanted to discuss this. I can remember being a new teacher and no way could I afford to pay someone $25/hr and as a vet teacher now I‚Äôm not sure I would either. Thoughts? Would you pay for the help?",

They announced that they would be getting rid of all their stuff from their careers out of one of their classrooms. Turns out they were selling everything.  It went poorly. We still laugh about it. Now everyone‚Äôs final memory of them, after 35 years of service, is trying to have a tag sale of used classroom supplies.",
