    "selftext": "Just posting here to ask if it's normal for a 5-year old to be unable to sit through a whole Pixar movie, because I'm flabbergasted. \n\nFor context, I've been recently hired as a preschool assistant at this place, and right now we're having summer camp where we play, engage in some light arts and crafts activities and watch Disney/Pixar movies. \n\nThis is the Toy Story week, so yesterday we read a book and today we watched the first movie. I basically sat among the kida shushing them and telling them to at least sit still while their classmates watch the movie for its whole duration. The 3 and 4 year olds behaved pretty decently given their age, being relatively quiet and still even when they lost interest in the movie, but the 5 year olds started complaining and moving around, laughing and playing with each other and just disrupting movie time for everyone. \n\nThat made me wonder, is it normal for a 5 year old to have an attention span this short? Toy Story's supposed to be enjoyable for kids that age. \n\nI also teach English to these kids during the school year. And I kid you not, the 5 year old were the hardest to manage. Always trying to sneak away from class and lying to me after being caught red-handed, some of them unable to literally sit still at their table for a hour. \n\nI'm worried about them, some of them have already turned 6, by September they'll be in Elementary school. \n\nEDIT: \nI don't make any decision here unfortunately, I didn't choose to watch a movie, nor I chose what movie to watch. \nWhen I got hired the older teachers had already made a schedule for the whole month\n\n2nd EDIT:\nI want to take advantage of the engagement this post is getting to add another question: how do I deal with the \"I want mom\" crying breakouts some kids often have? Some are more emotional than others, I usually take time to comfort them and it usually works, but some are really inconsolable and the moment I turn away they start crying again. Some teachers end up getting fed up and scolding them for crying too much, but I can't bring myself to do the same.",

            "body": "Yeah it's pretty normal for 5 year olds to not be able to sit through an entire movie, even an hour long kid's movie. They're still developing the attention span needed to sit through a whole movie, and they might not have yet developed the listening comprehension skills needed to fully engage with the plot of the movie. 4 to 7 is kind of the weird age range for movies where they're no longer fully entertained by bright colors and sounds, but they're not yet old enough to really engage with the movie for it's entire run time. A half-time break can help with behavior problems (think like the half-time break at a Broadway show). Pause the movie, let the kids get up and move around a little, get more snacks, get more water, talk about what's happening in the movie and their predictions for what will happen next, and then let kids get comfy again and restart the movie.\n\nEdit: Also an hour's too long to be sitting for a lesson for 5 year olds. Those kids have to move to another spot or have a brain break every like 30 minutes. When I taught kinder, we usually did carpet learning for 15 minutes, then move to the tables for independent work for 15 minutes, then moved to centers for 45 minutes with rotations happening every 15 minutes. They need a lot of movement in their day because they're still in the play-based learning part of their development and traditional schools are not set up to accommodate that type of learning.",

If you’re going to have them watch a 2 hour movie, I recommend taking a break every 15-30 min or so(depending on what you think your kids can handle and maybe starting off at 15 and working up to 30). Have them do things that get energy out like going outside or playing a game where they have to get up and move. The games could be movie related which would keep them engaged in the story and excited to keep watching. You could make coloring pages of scenes from the movie or characters and have them color them while watching!",

I also do a winter unit (North Pole vs South Pole) and then we'd watch March of the Penguins (I'd get parents to sign a waiver, due to the nature/death).\n\nMy kids would mostly sit through both, but there were always a few who would get bored and/or lose interest early on.\n\nI would lay out the expectations of \"being a good audience member\" and how/when it would be okay to get up/raise your hand.  85% of the time, this worked.  Haha\n\nMy thought is that these kids don't get taken to the movie theater anymore.  Parents can stream everything and when at home, the kids can do whatever they want.  No real expectations.  They can talk during the movie, play with toys, leave and come back any time they want, and so on.  This might be the issue.",

The last week of school we watched Finding Nemo over the entire week. \n\nI also do a lot of the Pixar shorts because they involve little to no dialogue, so they get exposure to gentle story telling through tone via music and visuals. Shorts also provide a way to be for all kids, regardless of language.\n\nOn a side note, the overall attention span of anyone to sit through a full film or movie nowadays is really frustrating. The excuses made for just plain rude behavior in theaters are out of control. This is gonna make its way into the classroom. People are allowed to be very self-focused in communal settings, so much of the etiquette practice is long-gone. Libraries are pretty much the last quiet spaces of focus left (and I feel like that is even on the brink).",

It’s normal for five year olds to be unable to sit through a whole movie. \n\nAs a general rule of thumb you can expect children to (at best) have a “sit still and quietly focus” attention span of their age x 2-3. This means for a five year old you should be able to count on 10-15 minutes on a good day. Some children, of course, can go longer, and some don’t have that attention. With preferred activities at preferred times, of course, children can focus for much much longer!\n\nRegarding your second edit, asking about the “I miss Mom” comments and cries, I’ve found having special pictures or momentos (which are often recommended) to actually be very unhelpful. They provide a new fixation. I go with comfort (a hug if they ask and if appropriate, a comment along the lines of “I know you miss ______. It’s sad to be away from them when you want them”) and redirection/distraction. Having an activity or two that you can get them started with is great. Timers or clocks can also help (“you’ll be back with ______ when the clock looks like ______”) as can “first-next-then” kinds of visual schedules where the child can see the activities or time blocks ahead. Bonus if they can remove or erase those activities/times as they complete them. \n\nCredentials: 17 year primary teacher, mostly kindergarten, and a MEd specializing in early childhood years. :)",

Such as a fine motor lacing activity or coloring pages/whiteboards. However, my classroom is on a daily schedule and has moved up from a classroom that naps. They know that after lunch is quiet time, that when theyre finished they grab their pillows, stuffies and blankets to the rug and sit down. I will often first put on a read aloud story or two, then a shorter (30 mins) educational program related to the subject we're learning about currently. This calm period allows the children who are tired to fall asleep.

            "body": "It's not their biological age. Kids as young as 4 or 5 can and have sat through church services, entire movies that engage them, and Thanksgiving dinners with little problem. Not all, but most of them. Of course, it depends on how they were raised as well as on their own personalities. Bad child raising coupled with a child's inattentive personality, and they're doing to have a very short attention span. That's always been the case. That's normal -- for some kids. But it's not normal for a lot of kids a lot of the time. \n\nSo it's not really their biological age, but how they were raised and what they are used to PLUS added to that our current social system which encourages parents to plop kids down in front of screens ALL THE TIME. \n\nThis has the inevitable result that screen time becomes normal time for many kids. And normal time is boring. When movies were a special treat, kids were more than likely to be mesmerized by them. Now they are daily experiences along with gaming and everything else on screen. This leads to both boredom with screen time and to shorter attention spans because we have to add to this one more thing -- all of today's movies and all video games are designed for short attention span people which explains al the noise and action and short scenes without a single moment lingering on anything for more than a brief moment and without almost any quiet moments. Kids are bombarded in order to hold their attention and keep them amused. Teaching young kids today, it's like they're going to school in an amusement park which is what their brains are like today. You could not teach anyone anything much in an amusement park. And game makers and movie makers don't give a rat's ass if what they do is emotionally and intellectually damaging. That's not their problem. Their problem is keeping their job and making a lot of money.\n\nThe result is teachers get these kids with their short attention spans and their addictions to screen time and their boredom with screen time that goes with it, and they have to solve these problems -- for a lousy salary and little respect. Society and bad parenting screw them up, and then you have to fix them -- or try to, at least.\n\nI've taught kindergarten kids -- five-year olds -- and held their attention for fairly long periods of time, 30 or more minutes, and you know how I did it? I read exciting stories to them. But this was years ago before every kid had two or three screens they watched,  before video games were invented, and when most movies were viewed as special treats in movie theaters, not endlessly day after day at home. Those kids years ago were able to sit and focus for quite a long time. Not all of them always, but most of them most of the time. Today, now that we regularly damage young people, they grow up partially screwed up, with short attention spans, bored, inattentive, unable to do long homework assignments, unable many of them to sit and read quietly, unable to think for themselves, addicted to video games and cell phones and social media, and unable to operate like the young adults they are by their teenage years. They are perpetual children well into their 20s if not longer. \n\nYes, it's very sad.",

If something like this happens again, do an intermission with some snacks/water time and a quick game possibly related to the movie (and, if you're clever, some of the ethical lessons). When they're all done with the activity, hype them back up. \"Are you ready to find out what happens?

Mom is a stand in for an emotional or social need (sometimes physical, like tiredness or needing calories/water), so if you can figure out which one or ones it is, you might be able to meet those needs. \n\nSometimes I crave carbs when I'm actually just thirsty.

Sit quietly in the back and color (voice volume no higher than 1, being a whisper). And if a kid wants to switch activities, let them, but remind them of the expectations. I’ve had decent success doing this. If it gets too noisy, I pause the film snd let them all know that “We don’t HAVE to have fun today, unless you want to.

In having a way to do that better than schools they’re rewiring developing kids brain chemistry and reward systems. The only answer we’ve seen is implement more tech for learning tools which is only furthering the problem. It’s like getting over for a car that is tailing you. Yes you’re out of the clear but getting out of the way only enables the behavior for future tailgating. 10-15 years from now things like cognitively enhanced students via harder medications or even brain/tech interfaces may be used only out of necessity to keep the learning process alive.

I would never watch a movie with either group. That is way too long for them to sit. It would lead to behavior issues. I can’t even read books that are terribly long. Kids this little just don’t have the attention span yet. \n\nI even set up my schedule so that there is an alternation for standing/playing activities and sitting activities so they aren’t sitting for too long. \n\nI am honestly shocked they are allowed to watch a movie in this age group. I teach preschool that is part of the neighborhood school and am paid through the district and have to listen to the district. The director of our program won’t let us do passive screen time. We are only allowed ten minutes a day twice a week. Maybe since you are in a private setting that is why they were allowed to watch a movie.  \n\nIf I were doing this themed week I would read Toy Story books, listen to the music form the films, show a short clip form the movie, and then find a go noodle or something Toy Story themed to dance around to.  \n\nFor your other question this is what I have done that works pretty well. I first ask that the parents leave right away so it’s like ripping a bandaid off. The parents have a really hard time leaving their screaming and crying child but I just assure them they will be ok and the sooner they leave the sooner they can calm down. I comfort them and ask them to tell me what they love to do with mom or dad. Once they start talking it gets a lot easier to calm them. I will offer them some breakfast and ask if they would like me to sit with them. So I will sit with them and offer tissues. They usually calm down pretty quick once mom or dad leave. \n\nFor the kids that are really emotional I will allow them to bring a small stuffy or calm down item to help ease that transition. I explain to the other children that these are tools and not toys and they need them to be in school. I also allow these children to go do something they love. I had one little girl that would cry for 30-45 minutes every day. She loved to write letters to her mom though. So when she came in I let her go to writing center right away so she could write letters to her mom and draw pictures. It worked like a charm. Was she missing carpet time? Yeah but she wasn’t a distraction to the whole class anymore. It was only for a week or so before she could leave her mom without having full on crying meltdowns.",

Sitting through extremely long movies does not help them to learn social emotional skills, problem solving skills, or self regulation.

If you must stick to a movie/theme per week I would suggest emphasizing the themes and characters of these movies through books, story times, dramatic play, brain-storming sessions, art time, and finally short clips of the highlights of the movies. You can engage them much more through interactive and play based learning about the movies. Discuss themes, predict what will happen next or what if’s, act it out, make puppets, introduce new materials or a new idea about older materials (i.e “I see the doll house area over there, what are those dolls and stuffies doing when we leave the classroom for the day and go to sleep at night?

            "body": "Kids are bored with screens. In general. I say this as a mother (ages 16, 12, and 9 now) and as a behavioral para. They really are. They get plenty of them whenever they want. Screens hold none of the novelty they had when we were young. They serve as background dopamine for their daily lives. It’s a normal and expected daily standard, not an experience. And certainly less interesting than the people and toys and other stimuli around, especially in kinder grades. \n\nI know I’m an idealist. And obviously there are always exceptions. However, classrooms might, IMO, benefit from a tech free (or at least tech LESS) overhaul, and instead focus on giving the kids the novelty they crave at this age. \n\nIn kindergarten I remember putting my feet in a kiddie pool full of bird seed, playing with play-doh, going outside and looking at tree bark and stump rings and bugs, learning how to make a pb&j on my own, building with wooden blocks and those big cardboard bricks, finger painting letters and shapes and artistic nonsense on a standing easel using basic primary colors…sensory and novelty experiences that draw them into the present moment. Then came the academics, then exercise, then snack, repeat. Then we went home because half days are long enough for kindergarteners, (but those days are gone), and then I took a nap! I’m a millennial and I forget how much I’ve aged sometimes. But then I work in modern kindergarten classrooms, and I realize just how much has changed. For all the talk about whole child learning, the classes seem to lack the substance we had back then. And for double the time spent, the kids seem to be behind where we were academically.\n\nWe can blame all sorts of things for this, and most of them are probably true, but I truly believe that regardless, we need to focus on grabbing the younger kids interests with engaging sensory learning experiences, and with predominantly natural materials. That is what children are biologically drawn to. And at this stage in the game, for public schools especially, a lot of these kids don’t have imaginations anymore. Or spend a lot of time outside (depending on your region). Many I’ve met don’t engage in imaginative play often, or at all. For a lot of them, their time is mostly filled with screens. The novelty therefore, is in the real life people, ideas, materials and experiences available at school that they don’t have at home.\n\nI’d wager we would have a lot less tears in the classroom on half days too, for the littles, like back then. Not that capitalism would allow that.",

            "body": "First question: Who told you that you had to shush anyone or tell anyone to stay in their seat? Those people can do their shushing and scolding on  their own, and/or kick rocks.\n\nIf a lot of folks are not engaged, and somebody in charge is giving me direction to force them to pay attention, I'd start off by making a Peace Corner in the back where I invite everyone I want to shush to come back and play something silent so they don't bother the rest and can still see. You don't have to watch, you do have to be quiet, and I can give you a quiet alternative back here. I will not play movie police.\n\nAnswer to your last question:\n\nFirst, check the kid crying for mommy for any real injuries or illness. Just asking if they fell or if anything hurts or anyone was mean to them can exhaust a lot of their anxious energy. Feel free to administer unnecessary real and pretend band-aids. They feel lost and scared, and you can bore or cajole the scared out of them by checking calmly for real injury or hurt. Give water, offer restroom, splash of water or wet towel on the face. Bring school-provided food or food the kid brough from home only and only when you figure out if they haven't eaten recently -- some other adult will always have a problem. Then you tell them that you know they miss their mommy, everyone does, and you know their mommy is awesome and their mommy told you that they want you here so you can learn and have fun, and I want you here, and teacher and student and name and point to humans and stuffies and the cartoon character on the screen -- all want you here. So, we'd be sad if you weren't here! Let the thoughts sink in. Go for distraction as soon as you see a window. On the order of \"Can you help me with this?\" Pull out your phone and show them a picture of your dog or cat and start telling stories and answering questions. The latter is for real injuries and emergencies, too.\n\nSit at eye level with your back or side to the kid so the kid might feel like they're hiding behind you and you're the lookout. This is a shockingly powerful way to tap into that primordial trust instinct. Then you can start talking to them quietly under your breath untill they're ready to talk back and make eye contact. Tell yourself and tell the hysterical child, \"It's OK you're upset. I am not upset. I know you'll be OK and you need to be upset for a bit. That's fine.\" Their favorite Disney song is, hands-down, \"Let It Go.\" Have a couple of songs in your pocket, know that some will fail bc that's the song mommy sings. But in general, \"I want Mommy\" settles down with a little confident compassion, but it will always come back for some kids, every other day in kindergarten. Sometimes they have to lean on you, so sitting back to back or offering your arm far apart from your body or even like a pack of kleenex from your pocket or an eraser that is yours can be a talisman of courage in a pinch. But sometimes, they just need to cry for a few minutes, and there is nothing wrong with that, even if it happens every day. It bothers some teachers, but not all. \n\nAnd btw, the other children are watching you like a hawk when you are comforting the one crying for mommy. So being solid and supportive for the repeated cryer has a ripple effect. Seriously, some day you'll come back from your break to find some of them patting that kid on the back and saying, '\\[your name\\] will be back soon, don't cry.\" \n\nGotta say, though, I feel like the scolding at your workplace would put me on edge. So be oblivious to the scolding and don't let it get your adrenaline flowing, and if you can't, move on to another job.",

Getting them back into the flow of the day helps a lot more than  focusing attention on how sad/upset/scared etc they are and trying to talk them into feeling better. As long as they're in that \"sympathy limbo\" they won't start to feel better. Invite another child over to share a fun toy; ask them to \"help\" with a classroom task; lead them over to a fun activity centre and back away as they start to become engaged with the activity and other kids.\n\nI agree, getting angry at them or shaming them for expressing emotions is NOT the way to handle it...but be aware that piling on the sympathy and letting them get \"stuck\" in their feelings isn't very effective either, even though people doing this mean well. Distract & Dazzle...that's how you do it!...lol. \n\nThis is the best way to deal with the \"missing mom/dad\" issue specifically bc it's a problem that you really can't offer any real solution for (until the end of the day, at least). Other problems that cause big emotions shouldn't all be dealt with by using distraction because you can provide guidance and solutions for those other things...like working through how to share a toy, talking through how and why we don't hurt each other, helping organize it so everyone gets a turn on the swings during outside time, etc.\n\nSource: Before having my kids, I went to school for ECE and worked several years as a preschool teacher with kids from 6 months to 8 yrs old. I was the \"softie\" on staff who all the kids gravitated to for extra emotional comforting, and I eventually learned to recognize when I was doing more harm than good by letting a child get stuck in a negative emotional spiral...and what to do instead, on a case by case basis of course bc kids need individualized solutions not cookie-cutter care. Also used this technique with my own kids on occasion...again, in situations where I couldn't provide a true solution or give them what they wanted etc...we'd sit with the emotions for a few minutes and acknowledge how hard/disappointing etc it was to not get what you hope for, then onto something fun/interesting to get out of the \"pit of despair\"...lol ;)",

It’s lazy ‘teaching’. I am a teacher trainer and have observed and written up many teachers who show little understanding of child development and /or appropriate activities. I get it.

Then on the other hand, you have kids who act crazy and if you don’t say anything they will get worse. The kids that forget probably 30secs after you told them to stop. And honestly the problem lies in their household. Something changed in parents. At some point we all decided, kids shouldn’t be held to any standard, because they’re kids. And I totally get that. But now, we have classrooms filled with kids who cannot, will not, listen to anyone not even authority. Kids that have no sense of authority but their OWN authority because they cry or destroy the house if they don’t get their way.\n\nEdit: kids these days also know that the more they push, the more you’re pushed.

When I started the course before COVID I could show documentaries and movies with little to no problem. \n\nAfter COVID attendance became “optional” for about 40 percent of our students. The ones that showed up thought movies were “off time” despite the fact they had well developed viewing guides to complete while they watched. \n\nI knew I was in big trouble when 20 boys could not sit through the new Mad Max!  My class was almost entirely boys by the way. \n\nI retired at the end of last year. Between attendance, “pass ‘em all policies”, and unenforced cell phone rules, I burned out. \n\nI did go and observe some of the new young teachers. They were amazing! They were whirling dervishes of discipline. They had to constantly move about the room, put away cell phones, break up private conversations, and regain attention. \n\nThe kids eventually got with the program, but if those poor teachers relented for one second, everything went Lord of the Flies. \n\nEveryone was saying it will all return to “normal” soon enough. I’m not so sure. \n\nUnless your school has tough attendance policies , enforced cell phone rules, and allows kids to fail, I do not think things are going to change much.  \n\nBTW the entire US Military recently had a meeting about recruiting post COVID kids. Recruitment was off by a huge percentage and they were seeing the same disinterest we see. Not to mention the kids are all in terrible shape from never going outside and playing video games all day. \n\nI work (I still sub) in a large Title 1 school comprised mainly of immigrant families. I can only begin to imagine how much worse things are going to get when ICE gets its 145 billion dollars and starts rounding up people in earnest on the East Coast. \n\nThis along along with the cuts coming down the pike needs to be addressed in some sort of national teacher’s convention. We need a united front now more than ever.",

The majority of Disney movies have 3 act structures. I'd recommend watching the movie at least once to note down when each act happens that way you can pause the movie at the end of each act. It might seem kind of weird at first to pause the movie so many times just for the kids to take a break (especially because the acts tend to be like 30-ish minutes long in Disney movies), but really does help them build that movie watching stamina. Plus, it can give kids a chance to do things like go to the bathroom or get more snacks without feeling like they're going to miss the movie. And also it can give you time to talk about what's happening in the movie as a group and their predictions, just like you would with a story book (like you pause when you're reading and have a discussion about the book). Eventually you can work up to longer watching periods, but it just takes time.",

The longer it is, the more complex the plot is likely to be. 3-5 year olds need to be able to comprehend, predict, summarize, and recall moments and then plots of very short books and shows first.",

Not better, not worse, I think, but realizing the strategies that worked for me in the classroom as a student won’t necessarily work for *my* students.",

My other point is a kid’s inability to sit for an hour and a half through a movie doesn’t bode well for sitting through an hour and a half ELA or math/science block. I can jazz up my lesson only so much, I’ll never be as engaging as a Pixar movie. Not to get into religion from a spiritual angle just a practical one parents aren’t even getting a look into what their kid does when asked to sit quietly for an hour or so anymore. I remember my mom giving me shit for wiggling around in church. She’d talk with me about being respectful and patient. Parents just hand their kid a tablet at dinner. There are also the social skills component they are missing out on from lack of outside interaction with their peers. They aren’t getting the practice they used to outside of school that helped them in school. Tough sledding.",

School is the only time a lot of kids see their friends so if I'm friends with X and Y and they both want to take welding then I'm gonna take welding regardless how much I care about it.

As an AI, I can't watch the video, but here's a quick summary of the conversation so far:\n\nThe whole thread is about how kids' attention spans seem to be getting shorter. It started with a preschool assistant who was shocked that 5-year-olds couldn't sit through *Toy Story*. Other teachers chimed in saying even their middle schoolers can't handle a full movie and will talk the whole time. The general theory is that addiction to short-form content (like TikToks, Reels, and Shorts) has made it difficult for kids to follow a longer storyline. The video was likely shared as a deep dive into that exact topic.\n\n---\n\n*^(This comment was generated by google/gemini-2.5-pro)*",

They won’t even just go back to the text for listing chronological order. Something is going on and veterans of 30 years are scratching their head. My generation sucks at parenting.
