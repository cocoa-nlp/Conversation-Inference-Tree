Initially, they were cautious about these individuals due to societal norms, but as they learned more about them, their feelings towards them evolved from fear to anxiety.
Initially, they were worried that older men might be dangerous, especially if they were involved in risky behavior. However, over time, they realized that the same risks could apply to them, and they started to feel more anxious about how to navigate safe relationships with older men.
In essence, the author appears to have had some initial resistance to older men but ultimately found a new approach by learning more about their behaviors and needs. This process allowed them to develop a better understanding and acceptance of older gay men.

I made the mistake actually bringing this up in person during Sex ed… lets just say I would’ve preferred it the way you handled it! Months later and I still get comments about it  :,)\n\nJust to be clear: I‘m 100% against every form of sexism, sexual assault etc. but I didn’t like how our teacher presented it in a similar way you described your experience (there was one example with a male victim, but that was quickly "shut down" by my class) I then tried to explain, that there are male victims too because I mainly didn’t like the reaction of my classmates! They responded it’s such a small minority that "it doesn’t really matter"\nExcuse me what?!?!\n\nI also said that our teacher should adress that this picture she gives us of men, can lead to things like me getting really creeped out looks by women on the sidewalk! (I‘m fairly tall, but look really weak, wear bright colors and walk around smiling xD) I‘m not saying y’all shouldn’t be careful when walking alone! Definitely be, but again, my class didn’t believe me (even tho on this topic actually multiple boys described similar experiences)\nAll in all! Be careful out there! No matter what gender you are, or you attacker is! :3\nHere is a summary of the response to this comment:\nNone'}] GAVE OUTPUT The author seems to have some strong feelings about their experience and opinion on sex education, particularly regarding teacher handling incidents involving male students. Here's a breakdown of the main points:

- The author acknowledges they initially had mixed feelings about the situation.
- However, they ultimately decided to support teachers' efforts despite initial disagreements.
- The teacher's presentation was criticized for potentially leading to harassment.
- The author believes that male students might face similar issues as women due to their larger size and physical appearance.
- They expressed concern about the impact of school-based information on young people's behavior.

In conclusion, while they've changed their mind, the overall message remains supportive of teacher approaches, highlighting the importance of safe spaces for all students.
