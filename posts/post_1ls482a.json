Please place ALL comments under the most relevant comment that I've made (inbox replies are off for individual comments but not the thread as a whole), so our advice-seekers can easily read relevant advice.** \n\n\n\nThe categories are:\n\n\\-*Shopping Deals/ISO Deals*.

            "body": "Hi all,\n\nThis is my first time writing anything on reddit. I made this account because I wanted to get some authentic responses from the right people. I'm a first year teacher. I was just hired and I'm really excited and I don't want to go into it totally naive. Some background about me, I went into an MAT program immediately after undergrad and I did my clinical internship in a 6th grade classroom. I loved it. This school I've been hired at is incredible small. I think its 3rd-8th grade with only 300ish kids. The size is something I sought after because I've always thrived better in smaller communities. I am going to be ONE of TWO ELA teachers in the whole school. I will be teaching all of 6th and half of the 7th graders where the other teachers all of 8th and the other half of the 7th graders. This is going to be a major shift for me because at the school where I did my internship, there were 6+ ELA teachers per grade in a 6-8 school with 1000+ kids. I did have a major support system at my internship because there were so many people to go to with more experience. Now, not only will be I have my own classes, I only have ONE person I can go to. The school is going through a major transition with a new superintendent and I've already developed a great rapport with them. They really liked me because in the interview when I was asked about why I wanted to work there/why I'd be a good fit, my answer aligned so much with theirs. I'm glad I have that connection but other than that one ELA teacher, the superintendent, and the lovely lady that I will be replacing (who I'm actually meeting with next week to show me around the building and share her resources with me)... I'm scared shitless. \n\nAnyway, I wanted to get some advice from all my fellow teachers out there. I'm literally open to anything. I am confident in my ELA skills. I know my content, how to formulate lessons and proper assessments, and do the actual in-class work. I just want help on all those OTHER things that I haven't even thought of yet or haven't experienced yet. \n\nPlease feel free to ask me questions to clarify anything or add more information to give more tailored advice. :)",

If you're getting overwhelmed with grading, give yourself a break and reassess what you're grading and why.\n\nI always see so many new teachers stay late at school grading and prepping extra hours every week. One was giving a math quiz every day. She had hundreds of papers to grade constantly. When they didn’t have a quiz, they had a test. Add on any homework they did and it was so much, I got overwhelmed watching her. It was ridiculously unnecessary.\n\nYou can accurately assess a standard without grading every page. You can give appropriate feedback without grading every little thing they do. If you must do daily quizzes/exit tickets, pick 1 to grade and the rest are completion grades or an automatically graded google form.",

Also make sure any consequences you hand out will be backed by admin because little Timmy will cry to mother dearest about it and she will come to the building to complain. \n\nIt’s also crucial to understand as a middle school teacher that getting your students to like you does not mean that they will respect you or what you have to say, and that can cause big issues. Do not be afraid disapproval if it reinforces authority. They will bitch and moan but at the end of the day I’ve found they actually like you better if you set boundaries and keep them versus allowing yourself to be a doormat. “Can I go to the bathroom without a pass?” No. “I finished my work, can I text my mom real quick?” No. “But [other teacher] lets me do it!” I’m not [other teacher]. (This is usually a lie anyway). \n\nFor every interaction like this that you have with a student, try to be intentional about finding something they’re doing that you can be positive about later in the period, if you can. Go to an extra curricular every so often that they’re a part of and bring it up with them the next day when they enter the class. No’s are easier to swallow coming from someone they know is supporting them in their interests. \n\nAlso, resist the urge to refer to students as “friends”. I do not shy away from having the “we are not friends” conversation, but it’s always followed by “I enjoy having you in my class and will support you where I can” etc. but they are little dumbasses that will get confused about the student-teacher relationship often. As long as you handle the conversation with tact, they will not get their feelings hurt when they’re reminded where the boundaries are.",

But you can find so many fun ones! \n\nI also had a wireless doorbell I attached to my lanyard with different sounds. Mine has visual feedback; every time I ring it, the receiver lights up and I use a hand signal with it.\n\nRepeat and practice every routine and transition pretty much nonstop the first week. Most teachers I knew didn't do a ton of content the first week, just routines and procedures. But it helped we always started on a Wednesday.",

If the kids use Chromebooks, you might want to add headsets to the list if the school doesn't provide them.  For you as the teacher, you will definitely want to make sure you have a supply of glue sticks, pencils, scissors for when kids lose them.  You'll need your own office-type supplies (post-its...).  Check your supply of construction paper or any project items you might need, paper bins for turning in assignments, a bulletin board calendar, wall decor, name tags... \n\nFor help, you could do a donorschoose or amazon wishlist but be careful because some schools don't allow teachers to do that.",
