    "selftext": "Today I begin my (56m) journey as a teacher in Peoria, IL with day one of orientation. It’s my 4th year as a full time teacher (3rd straight- took a decade off after a frightening first year experience on the south side of Chicago in a hell hole) with several years under the belt as a sub. \nI am nervous as hell. It’s a new town and school to me and it uses the Ron Clark Academy style of teaching. I don’t feel prepared. School for kids starts in two weeks.  Oh, and I’m the softball coach. I have youth softball coaching experience which led to ONE victory over two seasons. \nAnywho, summer’s over and it’s time to face the future head on. Wish me luck! Anyone who’s done RCA style teaching I could use some advice. Thanks!",

So they are able to do more than you because they are given time while you are expected to be perfect and give up your time after school and weekends. You don't get paid for that, the actual RCA teachers do. If it feels like a cult, it probably is, but the only followers are admin. \n\n\nYou'll do fine. Good luck with coaching this year. ",
