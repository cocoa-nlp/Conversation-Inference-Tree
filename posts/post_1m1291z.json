    "selftext": "im a summer daycamp counsellor. the kids range from 5-14.\n\non the bus up to camp today, there was only 15 kids being picked up at the first stop, so the bus was fairly quiet, with some casual excited chatter. we went past a money mart, and one kid asked, louder than casual conversation voice, what money mart is. i explained to them that its a place that you can go to where you could give them $20 and they would let you borrow $300 but make you pay it back and charge you an abhorrent amount extra the longer it takes you. they asked the typical kid questions after, like \"do you think if i brought them 25 cents they would give me a dollar ?\" and i told them that was a question for money mart. \n\nthe conversation died down, and i started to overhear the two kids in front of me quietly plotting:\n\n\"we should tell our teacher about money mart.\"\n\nYALL I AM SO SORRY IN ADVANCE TO WHOEVER HAS THESE CHILDREN NEXT YEAR IF THEY TRY TO EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW MONEY MART WORKS AND TRY TO SUGGEST THAT YOU SHOULD GO THERE I DID NOT REALIZE THAT THIS CONVERSATION WOULD GO THIS WAY AND I HOPE TO GOD THEY REALIZE THEY SHOULD NOT BE DISCUSSING THEIR TEACHER'S FINANCES WITH THEM\n\n",

They apologized and apparently she told them in reply ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre making a cheeseburger, it‚Äôs not about the buns, it‚Äôs about the patties‚Äù. The good news is that she stunned them into compliance by sheer confusion. The bad news is I spent the following four months saying ‚Äúplease stop talking about cheeseburgers‚Äù every time after correcting someone‚Äôs behavior choices. I‚Äôm assuming it was a variation of me telling them ‚Äúapologies with loot behavior changes are worthless apologies‚Äù but honestly, I‚Äôd rather explain a Money Mart. ü§£",
